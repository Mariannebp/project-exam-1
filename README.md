## Description

The Adventures of a Photographer is a blog depicting a photographers everyday photo life, which has the photos in main focus in the design. The blogs visitors will be able to get insight in both the professional and the private sides of the photographer, along with introductions to new equipments and tips and tricks for the average photographer. And of course enjoy the beautiful pictures.

This was my first exam at Noroff. The assignment was to create a blog site where I was free to choose the theme of the blog. The site was to have at least the following pages; home, list of blog posts, blog specific page, about, and contact. The blog posts were to be created in Wordpress, and then fetched to the site. The site was also to have certain functions such as

- a carousel to view more of the latest posts on the front page
- a view more posts-button on the blog list page
- modal on the blog specific page that shows a larger version of the image being clicked
- validation on the contact page
